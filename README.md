Questions can be asked, with answers determining
  a utility function over time from the present
  and Sharpe ratio. Net worth can be incorporated
  in the utility calculation, to more appropriately
  explain some common actions that seem to go against
  utility theory - e.g. playing the lottery (even though
  it's a negative utility action, humans may not be
  able to distinguish such small changes to net worth
  such as an instance of a lottery playing loss).

When asking questions that involve multi-year
  time frames, actuarial tables can also be incorporated
  based on the current age of the respondent to account
  for indifference to a rational choice that would
  payoff over a sufficiently long time frame for a
  sufficiently old respondent.

Since people have a hard time abstractly judging
  probabilities that are close to either 0 or 1,
  most questions can utilize probabilities close
  to 0.5 or simply defined as absolutely 0 or 1.
